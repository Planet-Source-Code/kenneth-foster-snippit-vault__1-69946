To display an animated cursor requires only two API declarations and one constant.
Declare Function LoadCursorFromFile Lib "user32" _
Alias "LoadCursorFromFileA" _
(ByVal lpFileName As String) As Long

Declare Function SetClassLong Lib "user32" _
Alias "SetClassLongA" _
(ByVal hwnd As Long, _
ByVal nIndex As Long, _
ByVal dwNewLong As Long) As Long

Public Const GCL_HCURSOR = (-12)
'--end code block
To show the cursor you first need to call the LoadCursorFromFile API. This will open the .ANI file and return a handle to the cursor. After that we call the SetClassLong API to assign the new cursor to a Window. The SetClassLong function returns the handle of the current cursor. We want to store that so we can restore the old cursor later.
Here is the code to do this:
Dim sCursorFile As String
Dim hCursor As Long
Dim hOldCursor As Long
Dim lReturn As Long

sCursorFile = App.Path & "\Globe.ani"
hCursor = LoadCursorFromFile(sCursorFile)

hOldCursor = SetClassLong(Form1.hwnd, GCL_HCURSOR, hCursor)
'--end code block
To restore the cursor just call the SetClassLong again, this time setting it to the value in hOldCursor.
lReturn = SetClassLong(Form1.hWnd, GCL_HCURSOR, hOldCursor)
'--end code block
