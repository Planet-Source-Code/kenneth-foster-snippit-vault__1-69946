Task: A good function that returns a random number within a range. Will not give the same number back-to-back, easy to use. 



Public Function Rand(Start As Integer, End1 As Integer) As Integer
 Static rndLastNum As Integer
 Randomize
Retry:
 Do
   n = Round(Rnd * End1): DoEvents
 Loop Until (n >= Start) And (n <= End1)
 If (n = rndLastNum) Then GoTo Retry
 rndLastNum = n
 Rand = n
End Function
