==========================================================
NOTE: If you Unload the form after executing the ClipCursor Function, the
cursor will still be limited To the last coordinates of the now-unloaded
form. To prevent this behavior, calling the ClipCursor Function With a null
argument in the Form_Unload event Is recommended.
