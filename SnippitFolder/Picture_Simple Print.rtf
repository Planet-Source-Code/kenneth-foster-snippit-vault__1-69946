First off you need a picture box or image box on your form. Let's assume that you have a picture box on the form called Picture1. All you have to do to print the picture in that is the following code: 
printer.paintpicture picture1.picture,0,0 
printer.enddoc 
That simple 2 lines of code will print the picture loaded into picture1 and print it to the top left corner of the paper.
