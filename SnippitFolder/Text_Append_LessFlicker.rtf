The usual way to append text to a TextBox or a RichTextBox control is to concatenate the current contents with the new string: 
Text1.Text = Text1.Text & newString
Here is a different approach, which is slightly faster and causes less flickering: 
Text1.SelStart = Len(Text1.Text)
Text1.SelText = newString
